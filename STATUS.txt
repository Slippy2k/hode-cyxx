// No sound or control options in settings menu (intentional?)

// Settings menu animates too quickly

// Sound quality on main menu, missing confirmation/selection sounds

Sound artifacts in cinematics when louder sounds happen. Tested for UK English PAF, French PAF, German PAF.

// At the end of cinematics a clip of sound happens

Very occasional cinematic skipping

// Sound mixing in-game is not identical to official release. Background ambiance (wind, etc) drowns out foreground sounds (spectres, Andy, blasts and falling rocks) in short, foreground sounds are too quiet

// Too much swamp noises the weird calling sound repeats too frequently

// Background sounds drowning out foreground sounds appears to span all levels

The screen in magic lake upon getting out of the underwater tunnels and first encountering the shadow plant serpents Andy will inexplicably slip after jumping to a hand hold below the first plant serpent if jump is held instead of tapped and pressed again. This isn’t a thing in the official release.

An Andy (not controlled by the player is repeatedly eaten by the shadow pirannahs. We can go about our day and watch. This only happened once on this screen.

If you get eaten by the shadow pirannahs normally it doesn’t play the full animation and crashes the game. Okay I tried it again and it carried out normally and didn’t crash the game that time

Growing the seeds on the small ledges over the pirannah infested waters required more precision than in the official release

Shadow spiders on space island still do that thing where they come out of the rock but all just stand there and don’t chase you

Jumping from first to second lava pillar is spotty, on this jump you can get hit by the lava but not die

// don’t fall when running on chain bridge

the last time you see the shadow spiders they spawn unendingly. This sometimes occurs but not other times

worm ai is weird. Can’t really describe how except that there’s too many of them/they’re too aggressive at that part where you first use the double spectres as bait

either the lava has more range than in the original game, or Andy has a more obtuse hitbox above lava

dying on screens that shouldn’t reset other screens doesn’t work, monsters killed in a previous checkpoint respawn

the double spectre trap door avoidance exploit (jumping over the button) does not work (probably a bug in the original game. to fix or not to fix?)

// assertion failed error after Andy in the cell cinematic plays

// many checkpoints in the lair do not work properly. Dying after losing special power drops Andy off several screens too far back

// tiptoeing over chain bridge after losing special power does not work, Andy falls in. Cannot test any of the game until next checkpoint.

// Andy does not say “YEAH!” after killing Mefudoka :(

// when collecting the pieces of the magic rock the door that is supposed to slam down when Andy is not standing on the button stays open

spectres appear to be more hostile on the bridge

// after beating the game and playing last cinematic the last frame from the final level is shown for a second before the game crashes
